# Learning React Native
- Projects for iOS can only be done online and can be sent to your phone that way
- To run a version on your computer you need the command `npx create-expo-app@latest` and the use either:
	 ```shell
	cd my-app
	npm run android
	npm run ios 
	npm run web
	```
- To use iOS on Windows you need to use macOS to build the iOS project - use the Expo app if you need to do iOS development without a Mac
