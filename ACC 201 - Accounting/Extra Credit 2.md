Applying the five elements of internal control:

1.) **Control Environment**: What was it like? What about the control environment made it susceptible to fraud?

2.) Control Procedures: What rules were in place (or not in place)? How did they break down or get exploited? Was it collusion? Was it improper separation of duties? Was it a false sense of separation of duties or independence? Did they exploit the rules? Keep it simple.

4.) Data and information: Is there data widely available and given freely to those that need it?  
  
5.) Monitoring: Are people watching things they need to? Are they watching for exceptions?
