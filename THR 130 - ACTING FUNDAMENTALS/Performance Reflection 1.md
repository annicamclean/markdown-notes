# Performance Reflection 1
1. Given Circumstances - What are some of the important details of the character's past and current circumstances in the film? Does the actor appear to accept and act in a manor that reflects the circumstances of the character's life and situation? This includes:

-   Believably reflecting elements of the character's past
-   Acting in a manner that reflects what has happened to them immediately before a scene
-   Being believably from or in each location they are in
-   Behaving in a way that reflects the time period of the film, time of year, and time of day in each scene
-   Portraying relationships to other characters in a believable manner

Some important details about the character's past and current circumstances is that her family is poor and her father has lost her job, she wants to go to a college over in New England, she has a complicated relationship with her mother, and is a teenager at a Catholic school. Yes it seems as though she does. You can see how the arguments between her and her mother seem to keep escalating throughout the film until her mother finds out that she applied to an East coast school and got wait-listed. Especially as she is pleading with her mother to talk to her again after the news, her acting makes it believable that the main character just wants to talk to her mother again. The actress was also very believable in about every scene, like when she is flirting with boys as an awkward teenager, or how she works in the coffee shop and grocery store learning the ropes, or how she seems like a desperate teen trying to get good grades by stealing the grade book, lying to her teacher (who didn't believe her) about the grade she had in the class, or cheating in class by looking at the girl in front of her test. 

2. Objectives- Can you tell what the character wants in each individual scene and in the film overall?

-   What is it that they want?
-   How far do you believe the character would go to achieve their goals?
-   What do they stand to win if they get what they want?
-   What do they stand to lose if they do not get what they want?
-   Does the character achieve their goals or objectives?

3. Overall Effectiveness - What do you think of the performance overall?

-   Do you like or dislike the performance? Why?
-   Do you like or dislike the character? Why?
-   Does the performance fit in with the rest of the movie and what the other actors are doing?
-   Do you like the film as a whole?
