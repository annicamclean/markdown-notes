-   Each category has unique characteristics and performance requirements, influencing how they are managed by the OS.
-   Storage devices are critical for data persistence, while transmission devices facilitate communication, and human-interface devices enable user interaction.
-   The variety of devices necessitates different control methods and protocols to ensure efficient operation and data transfer.
-   Understanding the specific requirements and capabilities of each device type is essential for effective I/O management.
-   New technologies in I/O devices continue to emerge, requiring ongoing adaptation in OS design.![A table comparing different aspects of I/O devices, including data-transfer mode, access method, transfer schedule, sharing, device speed, and I/O direction, with examples for each.](https://storage.googleapis.com/qzlt-prod-services-notes-notes-data/3d7d408b-3dbe-44d5-a622-1db5854ce493/images/04ddc1c1524b48b1871804f407900d98.jpg?Expires=1747054072&GoogleAccessId=notes-svc%40qzlt-prod-webapp.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Signature=00A9PvA8411Qb6FtLACaY8VDLEfubldjq4SznbyV3yLbaE%2BzyKldm8xzUXh3u7jL3NQ1DakxAisXZ3xPRwsZXZmkFgK2J3XuCrVH1r6No0HjahOSsR9l3PNh5AA4sSY%2B29ateNuPyEnT8529UDPsfjVWKrsqIpH6%2F7Ce2BUgTfIMiRJbDlLRYbZ11RSa8X7%2BYnZLeIZc0Kof2XrwhrIPYTqghDEb8r83DqiyWCGKr8flT6mdf42lcQ0Tmr2iaJ8%2FURJVtuE6QTERBS3US4fhzUcvu9MwBICKcAx6QCPSy%2BE1z0hR8vPoBmAMEszDu7Oqu7UjVzRASnkJ2u1wB0BgLA%3D%3D)

# I/O Control Mechanisms

### Ports and Buses

-   A port serves as a connection point for I/O devices, allowing them to communicate with the computer system.
-   Buses are pathways that connect multiple devices, enabling data transfer between them and the CPU.
-   The PCI bus is a common interface in PCs and servers, with PCI Express (PCIe) providing higher speeds for modern devices.
-   Expansion buses allow for the connection of relatively slow devices, while high-speed buses are used for performance-critical applications.
-   Serial-attached SCSI (SAS) is a prevalent disk interface that supports high-speed data transfer for storage devices.
-   The architecture of the bus system can significantly impact the overall performance of I/O operations.![Bar graph comparing data transfer rates (GB/s) of various computer interfaces, from keyboard to PCIe Express Gen 3 x 16.](https://storage.googleapis.com/qzlt-prod-services-notes-notes-data/3d7d408b-3dbe-44d5-a622-1db5854ce493/images/3edf6fb2d35b482a93e333751cfcd63e.jpg?Expires=1747054072&GoogleAccessId=notes-svc%40qzlt-prod-webapp.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Signature=Gx6az08r8bPThhjzJLBA7TpNOnP5%2FpnWkS%2BLyw%2FO4585019hc5d07N2wsTVL1HoNQYw7mS%2F0yI8r5p7SDzE8M5VjU75OP5k2x%2BQHOosd9xScTd9G3k7t5O50gtyZtVd1ha7cnYUmQk7ufqWKckiIMsAYEqmPxgGVmipWcNS1M5wL3Gf86wAjx1KzTKSkLlKE8f%2FtshT9Np%2Bs41pif3GoQ1ITe0YZWA%2FFa121k7cOT2lojqmuE%2FjmzVLbk5ATPpEqaDp%2B7aFd%2BQXQHVtbOXgZCbH4FWAQtqaOAVTmz5Xhkx3TLfjBwgA9QjRTH%2Ffm9iiGmvAb4YkDSaBqghUwgtuLAA%3D%3D)

# Device Controllers and Communication

### Functionality of Device Controllers

-   Device controllers (or host adapters) are electronic components that manage the communication between the CPU and I/O devices.
-   They can be integrated into the motherboard or exist as separate circuit boards, depending on the complexity of the device.
-   Controllers contain processors, microcode, and memory to facilitate data transfer and command execution between the CPU and devices.
-   A simple serial-port controller exemplifies a basic device controller, while more complex systems like Fibre Channel (FC) require dedicated host-bus adapters (HBAs).
-   Device controllers utilize registers to receive commands and data from the CPU, including data-in, data-out, status, and control registers.
-   The efficiency of data transfer is influenced by the design and capabilities of the device controller.

# I/O Operations and Performance

### Polling vs. Interrupts

-   Polling is a method where the CPU repeatedly checks the status of an I/O device to determine if it is ready for data transfer, which can lead to inefficiencies, especially with slower devices.
-   The polling process involves reading a busy bit from the status register and waiting until it indicates readiness, which can waste CPU cycles.
-   For fast devices, polling can be reasonable; however, for slower devices, it may necessitate the CPU to switch to other tasks to avoid wasting resources.
-   Interrupts provide a more efficient alternative to polling, allowing devices to signal the CPU when they are ready for data transfer, reducing unnecessary checks.
-   The interrupt-driven approach enhances system responsiveness and allows the CPU to perform other tasks while waiting for I/O operations to complete.
-   Understanding the trade-offs between polling and interrupts is crucial for optimizing I/O performance.![This flowchart illustrates the process of handling I/O interrupts, from device driver initiation to CPU resumption of the interrupted task.](https://storage.googleapis.com/qzlt-prod-services-notes-notes-data/3d7d408b-3dbe-44d5-a622-1db5854ce493/images/25aa971dcdac4fa79741ec6bb1c34ab7.jpg?Expires=1747054072&GoogleAccessId=notes-svc%40qzlt-prod-webapp.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Signature=KtufJn5arMtrydOgVvFiA4NZDrjGwNAGx5uhvcLKX03bZd%2B7xHg2rO9iGWsY%2B%2FzE9PRdEfukLRie8gMSot5QeidGgx%2FT2Nfc7lSNCj7fDPBy7ikGDLN7xF3ygJXnJAQGjSTzLua%2FatYTwVfRL4aJAYmE4%2BOIjW%2FYp3JKJS%2BeZD8%2BUErynrPcKcTKITlaoezdF3awynzBbKP7WoZUUkvbgNiWxyzm1TOcLJ1g%2FRkUXP20QIAW%2FqYQdhlj0uoVvY5qP4ajHAPYVNDXu6ifNUZhSkX1Tenh19tsD%2B2AwgKIF%2FvKqrfPrcbBUU5p2NM4EPaARVLakyRjYBmJ3P0%2BD5fdIg%3D%3D)

# Interrupts and Their Management

### Overview of CPU Interrupts

-   Interrupts are signals sent by I/O devices to the CPU to indicate that they require attention. This mechanism allows the CPU to respond to events in real-time, enhancing system responsiveness.
-   The CPU checks for interrupts after executing each instruction, ensuring that it can handle urgent tasks promptly.
-   An interrupt handler is a special routine that processes the interrupt, allowing the CPU to manage multiple tasks efficiently.
-   Interrupts can be maskable (can be ignored or delayed) or non-maskable (must be handled immediately), with the latter often used for critical errors.
-   The interrupt vector is a data structure that maps interrupt requests to their corresponding handlers, facilitating quick dispatching of interrupts.
-   Context switching occurs at the start and end of interrupt handling, allowing the CPU to save the state of the current process and restore it after handling the interrupt.![A table lists exception vector numbers and their corresponding descriptions, including divide error, debug exception, and maskable interrupts.](https://storage.googleapis.com/qzlt-prod-services-notes-notes-data/3d7d408b-3dbe-44d5-a622-1db5854ce493/images/1c52821dac5b43fb81508585aa43ea92.jpg?Expires=1747054072&GoogleAccessId=notes-svc%40qzlt-prod-webapp.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Signature=sERa0LTDeHB8ditFG6krNmDKCqZboos5c7iD2%2FJNSZkRiDREufPWJovXyAm0YZRVt3eA%2F%2BYQn9hGkZlLqtpIovZY23PGMLZpfkN6Sqoi%2FSpxPuzRYy4fvCOBDnon4%2BUdhUbbafaiCJ524yQPbv6bfTkq6E11VVv%2BoG1cy0SaBM0zoOaky9pDcb%2FHU9nu2LJE2ZiueEb8oiVqPktojlJE6k8lLAzyqt7KlrVierSb%2F35k%2BWArP7nTitJDjPvgi%2FPaoo4VALTyfYu%2BIXvUJux0LOf5AJmL%2BMbzZ0JHAuCNU3OPNvWXsDqDEfmMz1oiaxZYbRI%2BNP7xqk4PJjwgtEE0Rw%3D%3D)

### Interrupt-Driven I/O Cycle

-   The interrupt-driven I/O cycle allows the CPU to perform other tasks while waiting for I/O operations to complete, improving overall system efficiency.
-   This mechanism is also utilized for handling exceptions, such as hardware errors or system calls, which require immediate attention from the operating system.
-   For example, a page fault occurs when a program tries to access a memory page that is not currently in physical memory, triggering an interrupt to load the required page.
-   In multi-CPU systems, interrupts can be processed concurrently, provided the operating system is designed to handle such scenarios, which is crucial for time-sensitive applications.
-   The latency of interrupt handling is a significant concern, as modern systems can generate thousands of interrupts per second, necessitating efficient management strategies.
-   For instance, a quiet macOS desktop can generate around 23,000 interrupts in just 10 seconds, highlighting the need for effective interrupt management.![This diagram illustrates the difference between synchronous (a) and asynchronous (b) I/O operations, showing how a requesting process interacts with a device driver, interrupt handler, and hardware data transfer.](https://storage.googleapis.com/qzlt-prod-services-notes-notes-data/3d7d408b-3dbe-44d5-a622-1db5854ce493/images/235c621de1c042d2ace5e3642bb7c9a7.jpg?Expires=1747054072&GoogleAccessId=notes-svc%40qzlt-prod-webapp.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Signature=eEGd4vrgWfWwy%2FIn27RfIC5AOmLBPg9lrSv8iIvJoeyjjL3prx48F1V%2Fe6tBrQJTub80IUsNfsjIJsN8pac1bBoVEGjWb%2FsegUFzxauVCD5raELdcRxlTvM%2F9HkEcLNUSSudHPKo9L2OhQAdUUJZCSYe9m3l6gEK1ZQWiUFQiDU82pLcx8Bxyyo2CrLeglsshL%2FdBDqML7k5PWjZchlHDZ2tydpAAJBhuUeqlLQg2FQYhBL7EgEXSukqJ15dieFWJ%2FuZAel2fXTwBzUtgluEsmfxsjifQNtLCkAHD%2B4uxWdO9XnEpxc7HJIR8utU%2B6HYsM2R7%2FMFRI0o9KILXeiyAA%3D%3D)

### Direct Memory Access (DMA)

-   DMA is a method that allows I/O devices to transfer data directly to and from memory without involving the CPU, significantly speeding up data transfer processes.
-   A DMA controller is required to manage these transfers, which involves writing a command block to memory that specifies source and destination addresses, transfer mode, and byte count.
-   The DMA controller can take control of the system bus from the CPU, allowing it to perform data transfers more efficiently than programmed I/O methods.
-   Cycle stealing is a technique used by DMA controllers to take control of the bus only when the CPU is not using it, thus balancing CPU and I/O operations.
-   Once the data transfer is complete, the DMA controller sends an interrupt to the CPU to signal that the operation has finished, allowing the CPU to resume its tasks.
-   Advanced versions of DMA, such as Direct Virtual Memory Access (DVMA), can further enhance efficiency by being aware of virtual addresses.![This diagram illustrates the five steps of a Direct Memory Access (DMA) transfer, showing how data from a storage drive is transferred to a computer's memory buffer without CPU intervention.](https://storage.googleapis.com/qzlt-prod-services-notes-notes-data/3d7d408b-3dbe-44d5-a622-1db5854ce493/images/bb891ded888e438a861a9c60af817a02.jpg?Expires=1747054072&GoogleAccessId=notes-svc%40qzlt-prod-webapp.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Signature=ycrDIRLhIuw5YffBURM3%2FwrTLHsMkVS1Vx%2FV8BUPfzZF%2BJeVMAVT2WJvl1GtuLH0euhgK9XTDnWQF5zFuPYT%2BDlaWmzLHv4uFQ9dipg3MK0jLirr9jFALnOlKOs5dHGDvaNx1eodAl8TjnMg5M8uCo3TQqlfYVuX8dG0urgQ2Uy%2B0G0a0K7CYuMPY%2B4ZG69vCU94D2XhfsQmCwyvFdLbjBTzdBRsAidAEcSVv3ubE9jEKhrMnWm3SotlO5Eo71NXT3Kd27YOvajAmXif4drWOwcjmDWvt6yKuEDEh2GWE941cxTyp%2BviOtvt3NCMk1343dBeKZpjAmO4Fvs2Irfc5A%3D%3D)

### Characteristics of I/O Devices

-   I/O devices can be categorized into block devices (e.g., disk drives) and character devices (e.g., keyboards), each with distinct operational characteristics and command sets.
-   Block devices support operations like read, write, and seek, while character devices typically use commands like get() and put() for data transfer.
-   Memory-mapped file access allows files to be mapped into virtual memory, enabling efficient data access through demand paging.
-   The Unix ioctl() system call provides a mechanism for sending arbitrary control commands to devices, allowing for fine-tuned device management.
-   Devices are identified in UNIX and Linux systems using a tuple of major and minor device numbers, which helps the OS manage different device types and instances effectively.
-   The performance and behavior of I/O devices can vary widely based on their design, including factors like speed, access patterns, and whether they are sharable or dedicated.![This image shows a Linux  output listing four block devices,  through , all owned by root, on disk 8, created on March 16th at 09:18.](https://storage.googleapis.com/qzlt-prod-services-notes-notes-data/3d7d408b-3dbe-44d5-a622-1db5854ce493/images/796cd25d6a374a72803a6f9ab5233ae2.jpg?Expires=1747054072&GoogleAccessId=notes-svc%40qzlt-prod-webapp.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Signature=oovDGf2Ll%2BdLddsGhF4caq6XbXQCv%2F1ABtPoLUIQXbJE8xGLS%2FB4gwGIAU0PwBQDoLixblK%2B40%2FWjspUPFmuhY9Ipya7ZIlowVbRVvXbWwLxmR6FCujZiRIZqlMWmrIQaCeIai0KUZ4FhggzD3y%2FkPQ5SjNJZxa%2FrBseE5xhgdqb3xGj5m93hf4dRrC1TUekd%2B7IFSRPrR6F4VIj2hKKItFfNyZMQWH%2F1JkcomUMvvrUhJK690giFI3taBxQ65jsNCihdOSCPR%2Blbd%2By4SGd1xPFACzKSRom1jHjWjD2iF1H%2Fi3buOr1tn%2BKFAvLZCGp6v2hP8DB4PM9ZCrk%2FVvBCw%3D%3D)

# Kernel I/O Subsystem

### I/O Management Services

-   The kernel I/O subsystem provides a range of services, including scheduling, buffering, caching, and error handling, to manage I/O operations effectively.
-   I/O request scheduling can involve ordering requests based on device queues, aiming for fairness and quality of service (QoS) in resource allocation.
-   Buffering is used to temporarily store data in memory during transfers, helping to manage speed mismatches between devices and the CPU.
-   Caching improves performance by keeping frequently accessed data in a faster storage medium, while spooling holds output data for devices that can only handle one request at a time.
-   Device reservation mechanisms ensure exclusive access to devices, which is crucial for preventing conflicts and potential deadlocks during I/O operations.
-   Error handling strategies allow the OS to recover from various I/O failures, such as retrying failed operations or logging errors for further analysis.![Diagram of a data stream architecture showing a user process, stream head, multiple STREAMS modules with read and write queues, and a device.](https://storage.googleapis.com/qzlt-prod-services-notes-notes-data/3d7d408b-3dbe-44d5-a622-1db5854ce493/images/5f5bf12c874649e59a63c2b6ca578da1.jpg?Expires=1747054072&GoogleAccessId=notes-svc%40qzlt-prod-webapp.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Signature=i5VFTqB2D%2FSAzxfNXP%2BPoq7cxvFZWIvjnDmuDoeCaihdES5hrGIdUxAuT8wNJjRfsB%2BlHp8ISqVNfekpFddoR2F7auKlRt6A4qOCxSupe%2F05BhKA6tdRWOuNisVlrEtGr9yxtx1rf3QT2A1tAKcSVniCunZxQUR8v2wqvJDEZa6M6xn9ZJcIVw3W%2BoVWh2S7OFrhPePCvwaa9hgGCCUMmTm0OYgJ5fRBhTXg%2Fr7N4YQMAQi%2FOSOFlMmuErAwac%2F9ZBr3lOy9EPMNudacuW%2F9J%2Bt2j4m%2BZJ160xuEZsnZY%2FLU7REk18dq%2BKHBm1ST%2FJ2RPgo0AvtAQ%2BYQPZF2WL5IoQ%3D%3D)

-   The life cycle of an I/O request involves several steps, including determining the device, translating names to device representations, and physically reading data into buffers.
-   STREAMS in Unix provide a structured way to manage communication between user processes and devices, allowing for modular and flexible I/O operations.
-   Performance metrics for storage and network latency are crucial for assessing the efficiency of I/O operations and identifying bottlenecks.![This diagram illustrates the process of a system call, showing the transition from user land to kernel space, system call dispatch, I/O operation, and return to the calling thread.](https://storage.googleapis.com/qzlt-prod-services-notes-notes-data/3d7d408b-3dbe-44d5-a622-1db5854ce493/images/b9ee48b632374de7ac7d138ec37e9a80.jpg?Expires=1747054072&GoogleAccessId=notes-svc%40qzlt-prod-webapp.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Signature=XGkyJLkvNdySNfTxuPynFVEW0LMGTGS1%2F3yldeqiqjm6klt2z%2B6LPlMDW3s3B%2BhWdvWTy4O4f89cy0W5Yo5ZTDRtdappL57shoBXOvYOA6JOc4C9l8mIv8mgvwsfo593OWZZCc63fH0fDz5DgiSVlM1AZD36ty5qXaqX4wlRyH7GP%2FSUrkrEZFlHeytQbeZIKwzUd7VPGrAqWPybBRQMrkinC1ms4CUCrDxvb4VlQewlABYJtEvI87BkcBfJu4P98lb3NtrxLWqPM0tkaxjC1qag5xfiYHUUSp%2BwbNOJi1f%2BdEbKUt7V%2FFzHpXWVuT7rsXsZA40HmeSt8xTDMPekcA%3D%3D)

### Power Management in I/O Systems

-   Power management is increasingly important in I/O systems, especially in mobile and cloud computing environments where energy efficiency is critical.
-   Operating systems can implement power management strategies to optimize the use of electricity and reduce heat generation in devices.
-   For example, Android uses component-level power management to track device states and turn off unused components to save energy.
-   Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) provides a framework for managing power at the hardware level, allowing the OS to control device power states effectively.
-   Wake locks are a mechanism to prevent devices from entering sleep mode when they are still needed, ensuring responsiveness to user actions.
-   The relationship between components in a device tree can be leveraged to manage power more effectively, turning off entire branches of unused devices.![This graph illustrates the capacity and latency of various memory and storage technologies, including CPU caches, DRAM DIMMs, NVMe DIMMs, PCIe NVMe SSDs, SAS SSDs, and SAS HDDs, as well as network latency.](https://storage.googleapis.com/qzlt-prod-services-notes-notes-data/3d7d408b-3dbe-44d5-a622-1db5854ce493/images/84a9a8cac7584e6fa98a7fd0a1de87ae.jpg?Expires=1747054072&GoogleAccessId=notes-svc%40qzlt-prod-webapp.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Signature=sXbpDemgF1nZbftgYVEPjz%2FUtnra1vnu3UZ%2F5Ji8o7iWMtZr3aUXC4ih3vvz4hH3dEWl4JMjdGXJm2%2B82cZBHqT%2BdyiOmrZyxuZPfcpuDDjtiXMNd3DIdIVLcafgyKNu8PER7okRi9AFuwYLRJPJsYOj0ic5qVv%2BiiC54pm5l1uouXHvasMtJWTnpZfZghLCSbBF3YorHJRfy%2Fr3OEOp0aea25QPTZUQYWOZfapOgeLWM12RIUMvsX%2FCje0sJ75yErB2JVchsd9OJgv%2BSh6kF2aetozfrlDm4VEQIsEvA1gC5BuU71P3R3tuaYYVOxDIpkkwFPec4yIA96odQLpJLw%3D%3D)

# Advanced I/O Techniques

### Nonblocking and Asynchronous I/O

-   Nonblocking I/O allows processes to continue executing while I/O operations are in progress, returning immediately with the amount of data available.
-   Asynchronous I/O takes this a step further by allowing processes to run independently of I/O operations, with the OS signaling when the operation is complete.
-   While nonblocking I/O is easier to implement, asynchronous I/O can lead to more efficient resource utilization, albeit with increased complexity in programming.
-   Multi-threading can be used to implement nonblocking I/O, allowing different threads to handle I/O operations concurrently without blocking the main process.
-   The choice between blocking, nonblocking, and asynchronous I/O depends on the specific requirements of the application and the expected workload.
-   Understanding the trade-offs between these methods is crucial for optimizing application performance and responsiveness.

### Vectored I/O

-   Vectored I/O allows a single system call to perform multiple I/O operations simultaneously, reducing the overhead associated with multiple individual calls.
-   The Unix readv() function, for example, accepts a vector of buffers, enabling efficient data transfer to and from multiple locations.
-   This scatter-gather method minimizes context switching and system call overhead, improving overall performance.
-   Some implementations of vectored I/O provide atomicity, ensuring that operations are completed without interference from other processes.
-   Vectored I/O is particularly beneficial in multi-threaded environments where data consistency is critical during concurrent reads and writes.
-   By reducing the number of system calls, vectored I/O can significantly enhance throughput and reduce latency in I/O operations.![Diagram of a system's file handling, showing how a file descriptor in user memory connects to a per-process open-file table, which in turn connects to a system-wide open-file table in kernel memory, linking to active inode and network information tables.](https://storage.googleapis.com/qzlt-prod-services-notes-notes-data/3d7d408b-3dbe-44d5-a622-1db5854ce493/images/c359e1ba37b448348b8276ae383db4dd.jpg?Expires=1747054072&GoogleAccessId=notes-svc%40qzlt-prod-webapp.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Signature=LfatGXHR8rhRIHLhZp6pP7%2FYNSwuhhZdzQeK7%2B%2FsG3aHyFWnB5eaQtMQPQmE14l8R3XufnfN1zEWELpEJFOETcsB%2FMQfOtWAtLip9d%2FypRniQiuq6NjzBMv6z%2F9YCc4u3J%2FEmzJx4XrJVauDMuDVZPTKTwYUpz3JFs2uWbYg3fUzvYxoiMHia3aVIma0bRBzcp3uYEBnt%2FSnFa%2BiNslRQ0st0I7tqof3BFnGBeweQ%2BLzvMfVZC0Zczc%2Fldi%2FyXElaEQ0m2PTJR0%2F%2F1TjQ6JkCT%2FsE3XV%2BXcXEfoyYiyaUxqbbHdV7h8gI1fBEBMDaWiwXpGFiAGyRRblPOE7shB7Ww%3D%3D)

### Error Handling and I/O Protection

-   Effective error handling mechanisms are essential for maintaining system stability and reliability during I/O operations.
-   The OS can implement strategies to recover from transient errors, such as retrying failed read or write operations.
-   Advanced systems like Solaris FMA and AIX track error frequencies and can disable devices that exhibit increasing failure rates.
-   I/O protection is crucial to prevent user processes from executing illegal I/O instructions that could disrupt system operation.
-   All I/O operations must be performed through system calls, ensuring that only privileged operations are allowed.
-   Memory-mapped and I/O port memory locations must be adequately protected to prevent unauthorized access.![This flowchart illustrates the steps involved in handling an I/O request, from the user land to the device controller and back.](https://storage.googleapis.com/qzlt-prod-services-notes-notes-data/3d7d408b-3dbe-44d5-a622-1db5854ce493/images/6485242e74f54d269e0cefcf758e8370.jpg?Expires=1747054072&GoogleAccessId=notes-svc%40qzlt-prod-webapp.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Signature=E2Fz3NEhfLfjJAdWH%2FhfMb1yuIbYgF9bbl%2FVL6B3iHNdS8bSvdxrgfVsBQAQd9Ym3bT1nwlHSVqrI56RDfVGMdrzV%2FDzkAUbpJHlbFIrh7JuasxoQKrogHrg7PgWGlgQaFBBcbiA4Dh%2FlrTOcIXFCZXbZxo3nkYpmTsITSUTZaDxaeeSnaqQv1i2s%2F2I%2FXX0N40LMZ1tRKsS9HV%2BQtDotEBd0uWdMRIWXF4dIzVAYIrMrn%2FwfRnCvNeROcLQPWGg7cjwuDHtPf41V1CpMFiMOENnY9EOygsFuuwLX9P64IX2z9CaYr0P1nOX4Jo%2BUOps5cDMPZqIIPDohQz5tMBifQ%3D%3D)
