-   B+ trees provide efficient searching and insertion, balancing performance and space.
-   Hash tables can significantly decrease search time but may encounter collisions, requiring strategies like chaining.

### Allocation Methods Overview

> Allocation methods determine how disk blocks are assigned to files, impacting performance and fragmentation.

-   Common methods include Contiguous Allocation, Linked Allocation, File Allocation Table (FAT), and Indexed Allocation.
-   Each method has its advantages and disadvantages regarding speed, fragmentation, and complexity.

### Contiguous Allocation Method

> Contiguous allocation assigns a set of contiguous blocks to each file, optimizing performance.

-   Requires only the starting block number and the length of the file, making it simple to manage.
-   Challenges include knowing the file size beforehand and dealing with external fragmentation.
-   Example: If a file grows beyond its allocated space, it may require compaction or relocation, leading to downtime.

# Advanced Allocation Techniques

### Extent-Based Systems

> Extent-based file systems allocate disk blocks in contiguous extents, improving performance.

-   An extent is a contiguous block of disk space, allowing for efficient file allocation.
-   Example: The Veritas File System uses extents to manage large files effectively, reducing fragmentation.

### Linked Allocation Method

> In linked allocation, each file is represented as a linked list of blocks, with each block pointing to the next.

-   This method eliminates external fragmentation but can lead to internal fragmentation if blocks are clustered.
-   Reliability issues may arise due to the need for multiple I/O operations to locate blocks.
-   Example: A file may be scattered across the disk, requiring traversal of the linked list to access data.

### File Allocation Table (FAT) Method

> The FAT method uses a table at the beginning of the volume to manage block allocation, similar to a linked list.

-   Each entry in the table corresponds to a block number, allowing for quick access and management.
-   New block allocation is straightforward, enhancing performance for file access.
-   Example: FAT32 is a widely used file system that supports large volumes and files.

### Indexed Allocation Method

> Indexed allocation assigns an index block to each file, containing pointers to its data blocks.

-   This method allows for random access and dynamic allocation without external fragmentation.
-   Challenges arise with large files, requiring linked or multilevel index blocks to manage pointers effectively.
-   Example: The UNIX File System (UFS) employs a combined scheme for efficient file management.![Diagram illustrating a file system's indexed allocation, where a directory entry points to an index block containing block numbers that map to data blocks in the file.](https://storage.googleapis.com/qzlt-prod-services-notes-notes-data/49a9e5f9-1c96-4aeb-a8a1-5fe3fed4eb7c/images/64a3fe96510d4f14b5059c01994e0470.jpg?Expires=1747057403&GoogleAccessId=notes-svc%40qzlt-prod-webapp.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Signature=aoLWSUwFwQEdVxiX3bn61eYJNsMBcWJU0e0VrVbmLUds42LrgBaYXdY1M1ELMZFfgqDhYSdzaIJVKb9aN7G4vPw8M%2F%2FW6CPDVPXmObDHtLDj37ojD77ge5h%2BbZoa7foR1OVrkwkBb7%2FdrKPESyomw01PfheVhb55lAw4F8YVlKUUq%2B2oFj7oFn6S1rjX89ZZLzQd7vQGdgJO0OSHd9HHtCYBNolWEuBqbTcmpjz1%2FDPLZEqMkAEXJzFnoCDT%2Bj5OYUOfQzDX45AzFOXWCUGskLOM2ASMPwBA%2BZGUmEf%2FaJC7wxCM6Qeerdh2QXY1orrhGvGVtA%2FnQaXzl2NJM1le%2Bg%3D%3D)

# Indexed Allocation Techniques

### Overview of Indexed Allocation

-   Indexed allocation allows mapping from logical to physical addresses in files of unbounded length, typically using a block size of 512 words.
-   It utilizes an index table to manage the locations of data blocks, facilitating efficient access and management of large files.
-   The linked scheme enables linking blocks of the index table, allowing for a flexible size without a predetermined limit.
-   Multi-level indexing can be employed to further enhance the management of large files, improving access times and organization.
-   The outer-level mapping scheme uses Q1 for the block of the index table, while R1 is used for data retrieval.
-   The inner-level mapping scheme utilizes Q2 for displacements into the index table and R2 for displacements into the actual data blocks.![Diagram illustrating a multi-level indexing system where an outer index points to an index table, which in turn points to data blocks within a file.](https://storage.googleapis.com/qzlt-prod-services-notes-notes-data/49a9e5f9-1c96-4aeb-a8a1-5fe3fed4eb7c/images/17f5287f67fd460286c329022ff45e27.jpg?Expires=1747057403&GoogleAccessId=notes-svc%40qzlt-prod-webapp.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Signature=jUfkKHLiCx%2BgPgDbcdnuZkFmSiwped6VbGCIkaqiRV3ZjLScVnOu26Rq9DzjFni86jn8qeCDatR0dfLK5VZ9GY9dlxtvFmFCD45CcjQHJagvYK233g2ez2K88Oum3%2Fiu%2BxnzVTfs%2F4DxxlwkVYLcIs%2Fp8YCtTcqM1FR8NZY6ALXMfir1PNmOOq8JwjBMzTLH2oeLDMQk%2BVO0n0WvEHItSOfN8lxaH5gSH5%2BwInoz9lAscyuK%2FPp5VMS33S9zXbTSq68N%2BPeK%2B%2BFtRTqdqqIo5VLOpHste44rS7e3bXXI1uE34ntJY6JMdDw4Jt4q8UDiVz1Ye8y%2FZJ0hQ%2Bda7syoxA%3D%3D)

### Linked Scheme in Indexed Allocation

-   The linked scheme allows for dynamic linking of index blocks, which can grow as needed without size constraints.
-   This method is particularly useful for files that may expand significantly over time, as it avoids the need for pre-allocation of space.
-   Each block in the index table contains pointers to the next block, facilitating easy traversal and access to data.
-   Example: If a file grows beyond its initial size, new blocks can be added to the index table without reallocation of existing blocks.
-   The linked scheme is less efficient for random access compared to contiguous allocation but excels in sequential access scenarios.
-   Historical context: This method has been widely used in early file systems due to its flexibility.

### Two-Level Indexing Scheme

-   The two-level indexing scheme allows for a more structured approach to managing large files, supporting up to 4GB of data.
-   The outer index can store 1,024 four-byte pointers, allowing for a significant number of data blocks to be referenced.
-   Mapping schemes for both outer and inner indices are defined, with Q1 and Q2 representing displacements into their respective indices.
-   This method reduces the complexity of accessing large files by breaking down the index into manageable levels.
-   Example: A file with 1,048,567 data blocks can be efficiently managed using this two-level scheme, improving access times.
-   The two-level scheme is a precursor to modern file systems that utilize hierarchical indexing.

### Performance Considerations in Indexed Allocation

-   The performance of indexed allocation methods varies based on the type of file access (sequential vs. random).
-   Contiguous allocation is optimal for both sequential and random access, while linked allocation is better suited for sequential access.
-   Indexed allocation can introduce complexity, as accessing a single block may require multiple index block reads before reaching the data block.
-   Clustering techniques can enhance throughput and reduce CPU overhead, particularly in systems without traditional disk heads.
-   For non-volatile memory (NVM), different algorithms are needed to optimize performance, as traditional disk-based algorithms may waste CPU cycles.
-   Example: The Intel Core i7 Extreme Edition can execute 630 million instructions during a single disk I/O, highlighting the efficiency of modern processors.![Diagram illustrating a file system's organization, showing how file metadata, direct blocks, and multiple levels of indirect blocks point to data blocks.](https://storage.googleapis.com/qzlt-prod-services-notes-notes-data/49a9e5f9-1c96-4aeb-a8a1-5fe3fed4eb7c/images/ea50cf3050574bbe8a45154d6f908002.jpg?Expires=1747057403&GoogleAccessId=notes-svc%40qzlt-prod-webapp.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Signature=bm%2F3bDbW0Q7Pp1rV%2BsuLEJ%2FnVtMsRapw8mq%2Ftq1ej2lDNEyFJtWBALdUbYpQuJRa29GMP%2FnYigRDbUGiHJ3ba0qtF3SUtt5FFmiCpfDZc01itu26svZHxbNyhY0oaeAgo3ukhF29fSaT4KaMdq2n1y2XqUuNtUclMLk8iSsJH1LQMW6CZ6CnPC6jfsGGXm%2BwdlNj5E%2FbOd3v0tDsifMj5%2BOKyW98eLWSOiMefzHnEMf%2BZkRxe2NcVfCwsChnE%2FY3bYJvN%2BQJuiKE%2FUH45AcrAEXZgwgRD1oSSy8BshuyuLYhb4v318a%2BoKhisILmic%2BReA9VaDoWVXAu%2FXbc7NNXQA%3D%3D)

# Free-Space Management Techniques

### Overview of Free-Space Management

-   Free-space management is crucial for tracking available blocks or clusters within a file system, ensuring efficient storage utilization.
-   The file system maintains a free-space list, which can be implemented using bit vectors or bit maps to represent available blocks.
-   The calculation of block numbers involves determining the number of bits per word and the offset of the first '1' bit in the bitmap.
-   CPUs have built-in instructions to quickly return the offset of the first '1' bit, enhancing the efficiency of free-space management.
-   Example: A disk size of 1 terabyte with a block size of 4KB requires a bitmap of approximately 32MB to track free blocks.
-   The choice of free-space management technique can significantly impact file allocation and performance.

### Bit Map vs. Linked Free Space List

-   A bit map requires additional space to maintain the status of each block, which can be substantial for large disks.
-   Example: For a disk size of 1 terabyte and a block size of 4KB, the bitmap would require 32MB of memory, which is manageable but still significant.
-   The linked free space list, while efficient in terms of space, does not easily allow for contiguous space allocation.
-   The linked list approach eliminates waste by only recording free blocks, allowing for quick access without traversing the entire list.
-   Example: If the number of free blocks is recorded, the system can quickly allocate space without scanning all blocks.
-   The choice between these methods depends on the specific needs of the file system and the expected access patterns.

### Performance Implications of Free-Space Management

-   The efficiency of free-space management directly affects file allocation speed and overall system performance.
-   Contiguous allocation is easier with a bitmap, while linked lists may complicate the allocation of contiguous files.
-   The performance of file systems can be improved by optimizing the free-space management strategy based on usage patterns.
-   Example: Systems that frequently allocate and deallocate files may benefit from a linked list approach to minimize fragmentation.
-   The trade-offs between space efficiency and access speed must be carefully considered when designing a file system.
-   Historical context: Early file systems often struggled with free-space management, leading to the development of more sophisticated techniques.

### Linked Free Space List

-   A linked free space list allows for efficient management of free blocks on a disk without needing to traverse the entire list if the number of free blocks is recorded.
-   This method enhances performance by reducing the overhead of searching for free blocks, especially in large file systems.
-   The linked list structure can be modified to store the addresses of the next n-1 free blocks in the first free block, along with a pointer to the next block containing free block pointers.
-   This grouping technique minimizes the number of pointers needed and optimizes space utilization.
-   Example: If a disk has 100 free blocks, instead of storing each block's address, the first block can point to the next 9 free blocks, reducing the number of pointers needed.
-   This method is particularly useful in systems where free space is frequently allocated and deallocated.

### Counting Free Blocks

-   The counting method keeps track of the address of the first free block and the count of subsequent free blocks, allowing for efficient allocation.
-   This technique is beneficial in contiguous allocation scenarios where blocks are often used and freed together, known as extents or clustering.
-   The free space list entries contain both addresses and counts, which simplifies the allocation process.
-   Example: If the first free block is at address 200 and there are 5 contiguous free blocks, the entry would be (200, 5).
-   This method reduces fragmentation and improves allocation speed by allowing the system to allocate multiple blocks at once.
-   Historical context: This method has been used in various file systems to enhance performance and manage space efficiently.

### Space Maps in ZFS

-   Space maps are utilized in the ZFS file system to manage free space efficiently, especially in large file systems where traditional methods may fail due to memory constraints.
-   Instead of using full data structures like bitmaps, ZFS divides device space into metaslab units, each managed by its own space map.
-   Each metaslab can contain hundreds of free blocks, and the space map uses a counting algorithm to track free space.
-   The log file records all block activity in a time-ordered format, which is crucial for recovery and consistency.
-   When a metaslab is active, its space map is loaded into memory in a balanced-tree structure, indexed by offset, allowing for quick access.
-   This method significantly reduces the number of I/O operations required for managing free space.

# TRIM and Performance Optimization

### TRIMing Unused Blocks

-   TRIM is a command that informs storage devices, particularly non-volatile memory (NVM), that certain blocks are no longer in use and can be erased.
-   Traditional hard disk drives (HDDs) overwrite data in place, which can lead to inefficiencies when blocks are freed but not immediately overwritten.
-   NVM devices require blocks to be erased before they can be rewritten, which is a slow process, making TRIM essential for performance.
-   By using TRIM, the file system can mark pages as free, allowing the storage device to manage garbage collection more effectively.
-   Example: When a file is deleted, the TRIM command is sent to the SSD, allowing it to erase the corresponding blocks in advance, improving future write speeds.
-   The TRIM command helps maintain the performance of SSDs over time by preventing write amplification.

### Efficiency and Performance Factors

-   The efficiency of a file system is influenced by disk allocation and directory algorithms, which determine how data is stored and accessed.
-   The types of data kept in a file's directory entry can affect retrieval speed and storage efficiency.
-   Pre-allocation of metadata structures can enhance performance by reducing fragmentation and improving access times.
-   Fixed-size data structures may lead to wasted space, while varying-size structures can adapt to the needs of the data being stored.
-   Performance optimization techniques include keeping data and metadata close together in storage, which reduces access times.
-   Buffer caches are used to store frequently accessed data in memory, improving read speeds and overall system performance.

# File System Structures and Allocation Methods

### Linked Allocation

-   In linked allocation, each file is represented as a linked list of disk blocks, allowing for non-contiguous storage on the disk.
-   This method eliminates external fragmentation but can lead to increased access times due to scattered block locations.
-   The mapping of blocks involves accessing the Qth block in the linked chain, with R representing the displacement within that block.
-   Example: If a file consists of 5 blocks linked together, accessing the third block would require traversing the first two blocks in the list.
-   Linked allocation is particularly useful for files that grow dynamically, as it allows for easy addition of new blocks.
-   However, the overhead of maintaining pointers can impact performance.

### Indexed Allocation

-   Indexed allocation uses an index table to keep track of the locations of file blocks, allowing for random access without external fragmentation.
-   The index table itself requires storage, which can introduce overhead, especially for small files.
-   Mapping from logical to physical addresses involves using a displacement into the index table and the corresponding block.
-   Example: For a file of maximum size 256K bytes with a block size of 512 bytes, only one block is needed for the index table, simplifying management.
-   Indexed allocation can efficiently handle small files by linking blocks of the index table, allowing for dynamic growth.
-   This method is widely used in modern file systems due to its balance of efficiency and flexibility.

### Log Structured File Systems

-   Log structured file systems (LFS) record metadata updates as transactions in a log, enhancing recovery speed and consistency.
-   Transactions are considered committed once they are written to the log, even if the file system structures are not yet updated.
-   This asynchronous writing allows for faster recovery from crashes, as only the transactions in the log need to be replayed.
-   Example: In the WAFL file system, used in Network Appliance “Filers,” the write-anywhere file layout optimizes random I/O and write performance.
-   The log structure helps prevent metadata inconsistency by ensuring that all updates are recorded sequentially.
-   LFS is particularly beneficial in environments where data integrity and quick recovery are critical.
